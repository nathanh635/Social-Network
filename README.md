  ## Description

  The application is a backend for a social  network. It consists of three models: users, thoughts, and schemas. Users can post thoughts, and add other users as friends. Users can post multiple thoughts, and can also react to thoughts.
  the application is tested through Insomnia, as there is currently no front-end to work with.
